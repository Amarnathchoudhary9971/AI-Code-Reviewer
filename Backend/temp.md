❌ Bad Code:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

🔍 Issues:

- ❌ Lack of Input Validation: The function does not validate the types of inputs `a` and `b`. It assumes they are
  numbers, but it could lead to unexpected results or errors if they are not.
- ❌ Missing Documentation: The function lacks a comment or documentation explaining its purpose, parameters, and return
  value.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
 * Sums two numbers.
 *
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
 * @throws {TypeError} If either a or b is not a number.
 */
function sum(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== "number" || typeof b !== "number") {
    throw new TypeError("Both arguments must be numbers.");
  }
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

- ✔ Input Validation: Added a check to ensure that both inputs are numbers. If not, it throws a `TypeError` to indicate
  that the function was used incorrectly.
- ✔ Documentation: Added JSDoc-style comments to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. This
  improves readability and helps other developers understand how to use the function.
- ✔ Error Handling: Implemented basic error handling to catch cases where non-numeric inputs are provided, making the
  function more robust.
